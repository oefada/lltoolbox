<p>Dear <?php echo $userFirstName;?> <?php echo $userLastName;?>,<br /><br /><p>

<p>Regretfully, we have been unsuccessful in completing the purchase for your winning bid on the <?=$packageName;?> auction.</p>

<p>
All we need to complete the transaction is your credit card number with expiration date and billing address, so that we may process 
your payment.  You may enter credit card details online at LuxuryLink.com in the <span style="font-weight:bold;">"My Account"</span> section (upper right hand corner of our web site), or 
feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to assist.  
</p>

<p>
If it's more convenient for you to leave a voicemail message, or send an email or facsimile, our numbers are listed below.  
</p>

<p>
This email shall serve as a reminder for future bidding that all bids are binding, and a winning bid must be paid in full within 
24 hours of the auction closing. We respectfully ask that if you elect to participate in one of our auctions again, you familiarize 
yourself with the auction rules, as well as that auction's particular terms and conditions. We encourage you to contact us with any 
questions prior to bidding.
</p>

<p>
We work on an honor system and do not require credit cards until an auction is Won. We hope and trust that everyone will honor 
our auction rules and terms and conditions. Additionally as you <span style="font-weight:bold;">CONFIRM BID</span> there is a clear reminder that <span style="font-weight:bold;">"you commit to buy 
this offer if you are the winning bidder."</span>
</p>

<p>
The integrity of our auction process depends on all participants abiding by the stated rules and conditions. 
Failure to honor a future bid will unfortunately result in the deactivation of your bidding privileges. 
</p>

<p>

Warm Regards,<br /><br />
