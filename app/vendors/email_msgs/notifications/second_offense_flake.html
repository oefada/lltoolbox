<p>Dear <?php echo $userFirstName;?> <?php echo $userLastName;?>,<br /><br /><p>

<p>
We have been unsuccessful in collecting your winning bid on the <?=$clientNameP;?> auction that closed on <?=$offerEndDate;?>. 
Our records indicate that this has happened previously, prompting us to send you an email explaining our auction payment 
rules, and cautioning you to be clear on all terms and conditions before placing future bids. 
</p>

<p>
The integrity of our auction process depends on all participants abiding by the stated rules and conditions. 
To be fair to those bidders who are serious about their participation, we regret that we must ask you to 
refrain from future bidding. Accordingly we have deactivated your bidding privileges. 
</p>

<p>
<br /><br />
Warm Regards,<br /><br />
